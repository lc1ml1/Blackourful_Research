		<h2>About Blackourful Research</h2>
		<p>At Blackourful, the goal is to provide you with a tailored, bespoke solution for your B2B awards, surveys, polls and bespoke research.  With over 8 years of experience running all elements of B2B Market research from concept and methodology, through data collection and on to analysis and data visualisation, I can add value to projects of this nature on a targeted or 360&deg; approach.  I can fulfil both advisory/consultancy roles or a more hands-on approach and I am happy to pass on any knowledge required for you to run the project in future iterations.</p>
		
		
	<!-- why the name??? -->
		<h2>Why the name Blackourful?</h2>
		<p>The name Blackourful comes from a word invented by my son, where he was trying to understand what happens when you mixed words and asked about the mix between black and colourful.  When discussing the launch of this endeavour, he made me promise I would call it Blackourful.  The name also conveys some opinions I have on market research:</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Market research can often be seen as very black and white or binary in nature, helping make decisions between two different outcomes.  From my experience the results of many of the projects I have worked on have created much more of a spectrum of results and insights, often to the surprise of those commissioning the project.</li>
			<li>Data, charts and graphs can be perceived as very boring and my intention is to try and make the data come alive and become colourful.  I have seen many examples where this can work and a visualisation can quickly tell a story if presented in the correct way</li>
			<li>With survey fatigue becoming an increasing issue, my ambition is to creatively think of ways to remove any negative stigma of completing research questionnaires and try to make it a more valuable, enjoyable and rewarding excercise, hence making it a more colourful experience</li>
		</ul>
