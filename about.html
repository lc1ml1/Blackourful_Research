		<h2>About Blackourful Research</h2>
		<p>My name is Mark Lilley and I am the founder of Blackourful research.  At Blackourful, the goal is to provide you with a tailored solution for your B2B thought leadership, bespoke research, surveys, polls and awards.  With over 8 years of experience running all elements of B2B Market research from concept and methodology, through data collection and on to analysis and data visualisation, I can add value to projects of this nature by assisting with some or all of the elements you need help with.  I can fulfil both advisory/consultancy roles and those requiring a more hands-on approach.  Where appropriate and desirable, I am also comfortable to pass on knowledge/skills, so that you can run elements or all of the project in future iterations.</p>
		
		
	<!-- why the name??? -->
		<h2>Why the name Blackourful?</h2>
		<p>The name Blackourful comes from a word invented by my son. When young, he was trying to mix words and combine their meanings, the first mix was between black and colourful.  When discussing the launch of this endeavour, he made me promise I would call it Blackourful.  The name importantly also conveys some opinions I have on market research, based on my experience:</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Market research can often be seen as very black and white or binary in nature, helping make decisions between two polar outcomes.  From my experience, the results of many of the projects I have worked on, have created much more of a spectrum of results and insights, often to the surprise of researchers and stakeholders alike.</li>
			<li>Data, charts and graphs can be perceived as very boring and my intention is to try and make the data come alive and become 'colourful'.  I have seen many examples where this can be extremely effective and the correct visualisation can efficiently describe as much as a paragraph or even a page of written text.</li>
			<li>I have experienced increased survey fatigue in the B2B environments I have worked in.  My ambition is to design ways to creatively lessen the burden on the respondent and try to make it a more enjoyable and rewarding (colourful) excercise.</li>
		</ul>

	<!-- where can I add value.... -->
