				<h2>About Blackourful Research</h2>
				<p>My name is Mark Lilley and I am the founder of Blackourful research.  At Blackourful, the goal is to provide you with a tailored solution for your B2B bespoke research, surveys, polls and awards.  With over 8 years of experience running all elements of B2B Market research from concept and methodology, through data collection and on to analysis and data visualisation, I can add value to projects of this nature by assisting with some or all of the elements you need help with.  I can fulfil both advisory/consultancy roles and those requiring a more hands-on approach.  Where appropriate and desirable, I am also comfortable to pass on knowledge/skills, so that you can run elements or all of the project in future iterations.</p>

				<h2>Why the name Blackourful?</h2>
				<p>The name Blackourful comes from a word invented by my son. When young, he used to mix words and combine their meanings, one of which was between black and colourful (blackourful).  When discussing a name for the business, the word conveys some opinions I have on market research, based on my experience:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Market research can often be seen as very black and white or binary in nature, helping make decisions between two polar outcomes.  From my experience, the results of many of the projects I have worked on, have created much more of a spectrum of results and insights, often to the surprise of researchers and stakeholders alike.</li>
					<li>Data, charts and graphs have been viewed by some as boring and my intention is to try and make the data come alive and become 'colourful'.  I have seen and worked on many examples where this can be extremely effective and I hope to support this theory.  The correct visualisation can sometimes describe as much as a paragraph or even a page of written text.</li>
					<li>I have experienced increased survey fatigue in the B2B environments I have worked in.  My ambition is to design ways to creatively lessen the burden on the respondent and try to make it a more enjoyable and rewarding (colourful) excercise.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Where can I add value.....</h2>
					<p>In addition to over 8 years of running surveys, awards and bespoke research, I have over 18 years of experience interacting with the financial and professional services industries on a relationship management, business and product development basis.  I have developed a working knowledge of a large number of areas of finance and the B2B landscape.  In relation to research projects, I have experience in the following elements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Project management and client/stakeholder interaction</li>
					<li>Process planning and documentation</li>
					<li>Questionnaire and methodology writing and editing</li>
					<li>Respondent/panel development and response generation</li>
					<li>Data collection and cleaning</li>
					<li>Data analysis and reporting</li>
					<li>Data visualisation and commentary</li>
					<li>Data presentation with client/stakeholder interaction</li>
				</ul>
					<p>Furthermore, throughout my career to date, I have constantly been challenged to learn, understand and explain new concepts in complex and technical areas.  Therefore, if the required knowledge is not something I currently posess, I can develop my existing knowledge quickly and/or learn new skills in a time-efficient manner.</p>
